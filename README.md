Project Overview: Basic Calculator Program
Objective
Create a basic calculator program in Python that can perform fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should be user-friendly, interactive, and capable of handling basic input errors.

Features
Arithmetic Operations:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
User Interaction:

Prompt users to choose an operation.
Request numerical input from users.
Display results of the arithmetic operation.
Handle division by zero and invalid input errors gracefully.
Input Validation:

Ensure user inputs are valid numbers.
Handle non-numeric inputs and prompt the user to re-enter values.
User Interface:

Simple command-line interface (CLI) that interacts with the user via text-based prompts and responses.
Technical Requirements
Programming Language: Python
Version: Python 3.x
Libraries: Standard Python libraries (no additional libraries required)
Components
Main Function:

The central function that controls the flow of the program.
Arithmetic Functions:

Functions for each operation (e.g., add(a, b), subtract(a, b), multiply(a, b), divide(a, b)).
Input Handling:

Functions or methods to handle user input and validation.
Error Handling:

Mechanisms to manage division by zero and invalid inputs.
Display Results:

Output the result of the operation to the user.
